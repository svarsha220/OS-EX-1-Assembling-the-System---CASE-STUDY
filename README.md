## PROCEDURE:
### 1.Prepare your workspace:
Choose a clean, well-lit, and static-free area to work in. Place the motherboard on a non-conductive surface like its anti-static bag.
### 2.Install the CPU (Central Processing Unit):
* Open the CPU socket on the motherboard.
* Align the CPU with the socket, ensuring the notches match.
* Gently place the CPU into the socket without applying any force.
* Close the socket lever to secure the CPU

### 3. Install the CPU Cooler:
* Apply thermal paste to the CPU (if not pre-applied on the cooler).
* Attach the CPU cooler according to the manufacturer's instructions.
* Connect the cooler's fan to the CPU fan header on the motherboard.

### 5.Install the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit):
* If your CPU has integrated graphics, this step may be unnecessary.
* Align the GPU with the PCIe slot on the motherboard.
* Push down gently until it clicks into place.
* Secure the GPU with screws to the case (if required).

### 6.Install Storage Drives:
* Mount SSDs or HDDs in drive bays or brackets inside the case.
* Connect the SATA or NVMe data cables to the motherboard.
* Connect the power cables to the drives and power supply
